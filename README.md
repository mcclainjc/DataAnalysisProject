# DataAnalysisProject
Final project for Info450

When creating my machine learning algorithms I manually seperated the data myself in excel giving you the imdbtrain and imdbtest files 60/40. The results were printed as lr_predict and dt_predict respectively and then the "GoodMovie" column was presented next to the test data for visualization purposes under RuntimeResult and RuntimeDT.
